        <h2>What is C++?</h2>
        <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne
            Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded
            significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in
            addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>
        <h2>What is C plus-plus used for?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Software engineering. A couple of applications you might use daily that were created with C
                plus-plus include Netflix and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Operating system (OS) development. Examples of OS that were created with C++ include Microsoft
                Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.</li>
            <li>Graphical user interfaces. C++ is often recommended for graphical user interface design or, GUI.
            </li>
            <li>
                Virtual reality (VR). C++ can be an excellent language to learn if you want to develop VR
                applications.</li>
            <li>
                Blockchain technology. The well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin was developed in C++. It can also be
                used to create smart contracts.</li>
            <li>Game development. You can develop games and gaming consoles with C++. For example, the game World of
                Warcraft and the Xbox console.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advantages of learning C++</h2>
        <p>Programming in C++ offers several advantages. Because it is object oriented, you can easily organize and
            classify the code. Instead of rewriting code from scratch, you can reuse it. You can also use C
            plus-plus to interact directly with a computer’s hardware. As a result, you'll be able to control how a
            system uses its computational resources, like software, hardware, and memory. </p>
        <h2>How to learn C++</h2>
        <p>C++ basics include storing information, repeating actions through loops, and collecting user input. The
            list below outlines a few key concepts for C++ beginners to explore. Then, check out the next section
            for recommendations on where to start.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Conditionals like “if statements,” “if else statements,” and “switch case statements,” which tell a
                computer what to do under certain conditions </li>
            <li>How to assign classes to objects (data fields with unique attributes) </li>
            <li>How to write code using C++ syntax, the predefined symbols, and characters that determine how a
                computer reads the code </li>
            <li>How to compile and link a C++ file, so that the code can run on a machine </li>
        </ul>
