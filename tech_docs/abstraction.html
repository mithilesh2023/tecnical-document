        <h2>What are Abstract Classes?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Abstract classes can be defined as classes that cannot be instantiated, i.e., whose object reference
                cannot be created and contains one or more abstract methods within it.</li>
            <li> An abstract method is a method that can only be declared but has no implementation to it.</li>
            <li> Abstract classes need to be inherited and require subclasses to provide implementations for the method
                declared in the abstract class.</li>
            <li> As in Java, we have the abstract keyword to make a class an abstract class; there are no such reserve
                keywords in JavaScript to declare a class an abstract class.</li>
        </ul>
